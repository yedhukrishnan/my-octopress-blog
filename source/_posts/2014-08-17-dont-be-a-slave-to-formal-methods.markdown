There are so many well-described software development methodologies available: from structured development, CASE tools and waterfall to UML and object orientation.

Remember this. never get addicted to any of them!

It doesn't mean that formal methods are bad. But considering one without putting in your effort to analyse based on the context and developmental practices is a waste.

*Don't Be A Slave To Formal Methods*

Formal methods have some serious shortcomings:

* Most of the formal methods use diagrams to capture requirements from the user. No matter how simple it is, most of these look like an 'alien image' to the user. Finally, what the user understands is the designer's interpretation of it. Use prototypes whenever possible and let the user play with it.
* Formal methods seem to encourage specialisation. One group of people work on one diagram, another group on another.. and it goes on. This leads to poor communication. We prefer to be together and love to understand the whole system we are working on.
* We like to write adaptable, dynamic systems that allows us to change the character of applications at run-time. Most of the existing methodologies are incapable of doing that.

Should we completely avoid formal methods? No, but analyse before you use. Look at the methodologies critically. Never underestimate the cost of adopting new tools and methods. And also, never think about the cost of the tool when you look at its output. Extract the best out of all.
