### Binaries

In Elixir, strings are UTF-8 encoded binaries.

What is a binary?

A binary is just a sequence of bytes.  By default, each character in a string is internally represented in memory using 8 bits.

Let's take a simple example. The string "hello" in UTF-8 encoded binary form is 104, 101, 108, 108, 111. As you can see, each character uses a number (code point) between 0 and 255, which is represented with 8 bits or 1 byte.

You can define a binary using `<<>>` as shown below.

``` elixir
iex> <<0, 1, 2, 3>>
<<0, 1, 2, 3>>
```

We have the string concatenation operator `<>` in Elixir, which is actually a binary concatenation operator.

``` elixir
iex> "hello" <> "world"
"helloworld"
iex> <<0, 1, 2, 3>> <> <<4>>
<<0, 1, 2, 3, 4>>
```

Let's see "hello" in Elixir's binary form:

``` elixir
iex> "hello" <> <<0>>
<<104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 0>>
```

Here, I just used a concatenation operator to append a binary to a string. It converted the string to its internal binary representation.

The unicode standard assigns code points to many of the characters we know. For example, the character 'a' has code point of 97. Here, as you can see, 'h' has a code point of 104.

All commonly occuring characters have code points between 0 and 255. But there are characters whose code points are above 255, which cannot be represented in memory using a single byte. In the next post, I'll explain how they are represented and stored in memory.
