I always used to wonder about the things around me. This made me a 'wonder-kid'! I guess you understood that it's not because I do wonders. :-)

I joined St. Francis Assisi U P School, my first school in 1995. It was about 5 kilometres from my home. Unlike other 'normal' students, I had some adventures on the very first day itself. All what I know then was my class and division, but didn't know where exactly it was. Since I'd come by school bus, my parents were not there with me. I stood in front of the classroom where my admission procedure had taken place. Unaware of what to do, all of a sudden, I started crying. Of course, it wasn't quite embarrassing for an LKG student at such a helpless situation. 

After a few seconds or several minutes (don't remember exactly how long) one of my seniors came that way and asked me.

"Why are you crying?"

"I don't know where my class is!". I was still sobbing. 

"Which is your class?"

"LKG-A"

"Come with me. I'll take you to your class"

Sigh! It was a relief. He was a nice guy (for elder readers, kid!) and helped me to find my classroom. This was just the begining of all the adventures. Guess how it would be? I came late on the very first day of my school life!

"Where were you? Why are you late?". The guy besides whom I went to sit asked me. I didn't answer him!
