It's only once in a while, we meet people who inspire us. In the last three days, I met many of them. We were at Technopark, Trivandrum to attend Agile Kerala 2013. It was the first ever Agile and Lean software development conference in Kerala. Truly speaking, I registered for the conference only because I would be able to visit Kerala and meet some of my friends. 

But after going there, everything changed. The experience was totally different from what I expected! There were a few talks delivered by Venkat Subramaniam, an Agile Developer and Naresh Jain, Tech Startup Founder & Agile Coach. Both of them, and all other speakers took us through the World of agile and gave us a memorable experience to cherish. The talks helped all three of us to have a better insight into the concepts and practices of agile. 

*We were not learning agile, but were experiencing it live!*

The best among them was the live pair programming session by Naresh & Venkat. Unlike all other sessions, it was totally unplanned. This was really helpful for the audience because they were able to learn how pair programming and Test Driven Development (TDD) helped the development process to be faster and efficient. They showed us how TDD helps us to detect and correct problems long before compiling the code.

It's always nice to see and learn more about the practices, like pair programming and TDD, which we follow on our day-to-day basis live. Wait for the next post to deep dive into the learnings from the conference. I'll share what I've learned in two days.
