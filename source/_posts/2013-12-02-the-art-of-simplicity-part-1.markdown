It was for the first time, that we were visiting Technopark, Trivandrum. Thatâ€™s one of the main reasons as to why we reached a little late. Dr. Venkat Subramaniam had already started delivering his keynote on *The Art of Simplicity*. Here, I am extracting some key points from it (I am directly jumping into the topic since I missed the first few minutes of the session!)...

Simplicity.. Being simple is always distraction-free. One example that we see and use in our day to day life is Google. Imagine, we are in the middle of a serious coding session. Suddenly, some confusion strikes our mind and we decide search for a better implementation or syntax. In the World of internet, there are a lot of things that can distract us. They tempt us to navigate away from our real goal, thereby, wasting a good share of our productive time.

This is where Google comes to help us. In the home page of Google, there is nothing to deviate us from our real intention. Just search, get what you want and leave! The real courage lies in developing such simple and elegant systems rather than complicating it with detailed designs or images.

Simple fails less. If at all it fails, it is always easy to find out the problem and cure it. Simple is always easy to understand.

Simple is always mutable. We neither have to change much, nor worry about anything else before changing it.

Here is a famous quote by Richard Feynman, an American theoretical physicist:

*If you can't explain something to a first year student, then you haven't really understood it.*

*(to be continued...)*
