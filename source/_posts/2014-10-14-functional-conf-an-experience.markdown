I got a chance to attend Asia's first Functional Conf, which happened here in Bangalore. It was really a wonderful experience! I must say that I am completely new to the concept functional programming. Before going to the conference, elixir was my only option to learn about it. But at the conference, I met different personalities who inspired me with a variety ideas and languages.

The conference started with the keynote by Venkat Subramaniam. He explained why we need to do functional programming and its basic concepts. Here are the key points I learned from the keynote: Declarative style of programming focuses on *what to do*, rather than imperative style, which concentrates on *what to do* and *how to do*. The *how to do* part, being abstracted away from us helps us to concentrate on solving the problem in hand.

Most of the talks were really interesting and the ideas were completely new to me. I got a bunch of stuff to try out, like APL and languages like Haskel and Clojure.

I had also attended a workshop on elixir language conducted by Bruce Tate, the author of the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. It helped me to take a deep dive into the language  and functional programming way of approaching it.

By the end of the conference, I understood that I have to change in my way of thinking and approaching the problem. The real shift has to happen, not in the languages we use, but in the mind of the programmer.

What else did I learn from the conference and workshop? The answer is simple. My level of understanding about functional programming was really low before attending the conference. That doesn't mean that I understood everything just after that, but it helped to light a small fire in me. I should learn and explore more.

*After the keynote, someone from the audience asked Venkat about his favourite programming language. His answer was really interesting.*

*"I reached Bangalore in a flight. From the airport I reached the venue in a car. When I am free, I like to roam around the places. In a crowded city like Bangalore, I would prefer a bicycle. If you ask me which language do I like the most, the answer is similar. Some languages are fast, but that may not be the right choice at a given time. The right answer depends on the given situation."*
