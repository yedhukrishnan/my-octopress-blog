Online World is the best place to find me. I live online. I love to connect with my friends through [Facebook][facebook]. I share my thoughts via [Twitter][twitter]. You'll find all my crazy and techie stuff there in Twitter!! For people who seek a much more professional kinda relationship, don't worry, I am there in [LinkedIn][linkedin]. But, please don't take it personally. I don't come there often... ;-)

As I said already, I love programming. I believe in the concept of Free Software. So, you'll find me in [GitHub][github] also.

I love writing stories. I have a blog dedicated for the same. Check out my blog [swapnathalukal][swapnathalukal] to read and criticize. This is only for people who can read (and understand) Malayalam. I'll think about writing in English also (though I am not good at it yet). Here, you can find [My Technical Journal][my_tech_journal]. This is the blog where I write the summary of what I read and what I learn. There are some other blogs too, but I don't write in them regularly. I'll add it later, if it's ever gonna be interesting in the future.

I dunno where else I am present. Just Google 'Yedhu Krishnan'. You'll probably find me everywhere.
