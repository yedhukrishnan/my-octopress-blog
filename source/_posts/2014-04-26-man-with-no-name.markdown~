This is not about a man with no name. Actually he might have a good name. It's my way of conveying the fact that his name is unknown to me.

I meet a man with no name during every journey. Some are interesting, some are boring while some others are interestingly annoying! But everyone has a story to tell and a lot of things to ask me. I interact with these people a lot. But only once in a while, we ask each others' name. Even after that, the chances of remembering their name is very less. Now you know why I refer each one of them as a 'man with no name'.

Let us hear some of their stories.

I remember meeting a person who was going to Bangalore for ordering granites and marbles for his client. From the time he boarded into the bus, he kept on talking to me for two hours continuously! He talked about everything; what he did, what he's doing and what he's planning to do in his life. In that two hours span, he allowed me to talk only once. He asked me suggestion on buying a tablet. He wanted to choose between Android and Windows tablet. In fact, he's a man with lots of experience. But he comes under the category: interestingly annoying.

Once, in a journey back to my home, I met a software engineer. While talking about his family and his children, he was really excited. He had a reason for this and I was happy to know that. He was going home to see his new-born for the first time. He asked me about my job and my company. He discussed about his job as well. He was a good man. He comes under the category: interesting.

So far, I couldn't find a man in the third (boring) category. I don't know why. It could be because, I always find something interesting in their story. It happens. Every story has something special in it. It doesn't matter whether he is an interesting or interestingly annoying person.

Life always comes as the weirdest, stupidest or the prettiest story to each and every one of us. Love your life in the way it is, and let it write the next chapter...
