Here comes yet another blog from me. I love creating new blogs every day, but I write less. I dunno how this is gonna be. But I'll try to continue with my journal.

A little bit about me: I'm Yedhu Krishnan, a person full of dreams, who is caring and passionate about many good things. Sorry, if this is too much! :P I love to read and write. I like blogging, photography (always wanna be a good photographer). I love the people around me. I am passionate about programming. I currently work as a Product Developer in Multunus Software, Bangalore.

I write about whatever I love. It may not be always (or never) interesting for you. You may consider this as my unofficial disclaimer! :-)

Take care, gonna write more, more often,

Yedhu Krishnan
