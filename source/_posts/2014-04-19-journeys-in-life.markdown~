I never knew that I like travelling. One reason for this was I never used to travel a lot. I always loved being at home. My journeys were limited - from home to school and later, from home to college. I never even went for any outings while I was in school.

I have some vague memories. My parents used to take us for occasional Palani trips while me and my brother were kids (There are some interesting stories related to that. I'll think about writing them in another post ;)). Those were the longest trips I ever had during my childhood days.

I went for a tour with my friends for the first time while I was in college. That was a long trip which I clearly remember. Apart from that, I also had two Trivandrum trips. One was after my 12th standard. I went to Trivandrum with my father to get some certificates. Second one was for writing a placement related exam.

Then things began to change. It was during our recruitment days. I had to attend an interview at Microsoft India Development Center, Bangalore. It was a thrilling experience because of many reasons. There were a couple of first time experiences: I was travelling more than 600 kilometres and I was visiting Bangalore! There were some other reasons too. That time, we travelled another 200+ kilometres, with my father's cousin living in Bangalore, to a place called Hindupur, Andhra Pradesh. It's in Karnataka - Andhra Pradesh border. Around 20 years ago, my father, grandfather and his brothers and family were living there. They were at Hindupur for more than 15 years.

But unfortunately, the interview didn't go well. I couldn't get through it. I wasn't very depressed. I had a very good time travelling and seeing places around Bangalore and Hindupur. I had also made up my mind not to get distracted by failures in interviews. 

And, that was not the end. Very soon, I had another interview to attend in Bangalore. That was my chance to visit Bangalore again. I was getting more and more familiar with Bangalore city. I cleared those interview rounds. The interview was in the company where I currently work. After my college days, I moved to Bangalore to join the company. It was a sudden change from college to work. For me, it was more of a change from home to a different place. Initially, it wasn't so comfortable. Somehow, I managed to adjust.

Now, things are so different from what it was before. It all started due to homesickness. I go home once in every two weeks. I started liking long travels from Bangalore to Kochi and return trips. Every journey has something new to share with me.

It's a journey through different cultures and languages. Something that is so similar to the journey of life, where we meet different people at different times. 

Life is a journey, like the one I am currently in...

I forgot to mention. I am on my way from hometown to Bangalore. My bus is currently halted for dinner. It's the right time to scribble.
