I love to read and write. I am trying to improve by writing more and more. This is one reason why I create blogs every day. Now you know the truth :P 

I started reading books when I was a kid. It all started with Malayalam children's magazines like 'kalikkudukka', 'balarama', 'balabhoomi', 'balamangalam', 'muthassi', 'thathamma' and many more. Yeah!, all these were my favourites then. I still have them in our book shelf and I love to go through them even now. My parents never discouraged me from reading books. They used to buy me books every time when they go out. Mostly, I'd ask them to get books for me . Those were the first steps. I fell in love with books.

When I grew up, I started getting more and more interested in books. Nowadays, it's one of my routines to go and spend some time in bookshops like Landmark and Crossword. I may not buy books all the time. But it's nice to see them and know about the latest arrivals often.

Books are always a passion. Now, books can be read using electronic e-book readers or mobile phones. Whatever the medium is, reading is always fun.

Along with reading, I also used write a lot. I had (guess I still have) diaries full of my stories and some poems. Those are still unpublished stories.. ;-)

Now, a secret. I am thinking about (actually started) writing a book about my college days. This doesn't mean that my college days were jam packed with suspenses or surprising incidents. It's a dream. I will complete it as soon as possible. Wish me good luck.
